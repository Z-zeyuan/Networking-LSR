ReadMe:

Although it is unlikely for us to have a demo we still kept a part of testing code just in case.

To test our code:

first, you can find intellij running config for 7 routers in &nbsp;LSR\LinkStateRouting\comp535_sketch_code\.idea,
But if you have to build this up manually you can just do the same as template code, we didn't change things relate to that.

Please remember to set up the running dir in comp535_sketch_code (it took us a day to set up everything correctly)

Then about the function of our code:

As it is so unclear what a start should achieve, we decide that it should set up it's own entry in store, Get and exchange info with it's neighbor.
But in order to register every router into network, in case you are attaching then starting you need to start every router one by one after all attaching.

If you want to connect to a running network, you just need to start and connect to whoever you want(also started)
We are printing in case a LSA is received and the connection type changes.

If you are testing detect, disconnect , quit:
Please note as it make no sense to use port num 0-3 in hand out,
To disconnect R2 from R1 &nbsp;you just need to input "disconnect R2_port_num" in the R1 terminal.

Below are commands you need to do test in the handout, you just have to change the process IP to test on your machine.

start

connect 192.168.2.16 5002 192.168.1.100 (in R1,R3)
connect 192.168.2.16 5001 192.168.1.1 (in R6,R7)
connect 192.168.2.16 5004 192.168.3.1 (in R3,R5,R6)
connect 192.168.2.16 5005 192.168.4.1 (in R7)

attach 192.168.2.16 5002 192.168.1.100 (Same as above)
attach 192.168.2.16 5001 192.168.1.1
attach 192.168.2.16 5004 192.168.3.1
attach 192.168.2.16 5005 192.168.4.1

disconnect 5007 (in R5)
detect 192.168.3.1
quit (in R6)
